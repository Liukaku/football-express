# ExpressJS API

Valid routes are cached

There is a route to clear the cache with no JWT validation for ease of use

- Fetch data from: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football/pricing.
- One endpoint for all fixtures, one for a specific fixture and all odds relating
- JWT auth validation
- Cache when a response is given so that invalid requests aren't cached, data not available yet wont be cached.
